3|You just purchased some new switches for your company’s network. Your junior technicians are doing most of the work connecting switches to workstations and to each other, and you don’t want to confuse them by requiring them to use both patch cables and crossover cables. How can you test the switches to determine whether you need both types of cable, and what’s the feature for using only one type of cable for all connections? a. Connect the switch to a PC NIC and configure different speeds on the NIC by using the NIC driver. You’re okay if the switch links at all speeds. It’s called auto-MDIX. b. Connect two switches by using a crossover cable. If the connection works, the switch supports auto-negotiate. c. Connect the switch to a PC NIC and configure different speeds on the NIC by using the NIC driver. You’re okay if the switch links at all speeds. It’s called auto-negotiate. d. Connect two switches by using a patch cable. If the connection works, the switch supports auto-MDIX.|d. Connect two switches by using a patch cable. If the connection works, the switch supports auto-MDIX.
